# PolycysticKidneyDiseaseMachineLearning
This repo contains my studies on the diagnosis of Polycystic Kidney disease. I am working on the data of 150 patients and their 21 different medical test results when they first visit the hospital and gfr(Glomerular Filtration Rate) loss after 5 years follow-up. I am trying to find a model that can precisely predict gfr loss of the patient beforehand.
